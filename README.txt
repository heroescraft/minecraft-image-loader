minecraft-image-loader

This is a hybrid datapack/console-program, which means you can't install it like regular datapacks. To help you out, I've provided detailed instructions that should be pretty easy to follow.So what does it do? It uses a Python program to generate a .mcfunction file, which in turn creates tons of particles in mc, that are arranged and colored to look exactly like the image you fed into the system. Since it is particle based it can get laggy and glitchy, but it works pretty well.How to get started?After downloading the it, open the .zip and double click the "README.html". Follow those instructions, and get converting images into .mcfunctions!Please Comment any questions!!! This system is complicated, but it WORKS!!!
